# CalendarStreet
CalendarStreet is a java based app that utilizes OpenStreetMap and mapjfx and our own GUI to create
a map that displays your calendar of events. This app would also allow you to see events at different
locations and allow you to add them to your calendar of events.

Currently, CalendarStreet is being created with college campuses in mind as students create new schedules,
this app would help them determine walking distance and routes. CalendarStreet also was created with the
hectic college life of students in mind with their various events and social activities.

CalenderStreet overall is a calendar-map hybrid designed to allow visualization of one's schedule.
